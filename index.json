Janizek","type":"authors"},{"authors":["Joseph D. Janizek"],"categories":null,"content":"Yesterday I saw this MIT Technology Review article article shared on Twitter. The article, which summarizes this recent work on energy consumption in Deep Learning in NLP, points out that training a handful of recent state-of-the-art models in Natural Language Processing can be incredibly energy-intensive. Training a Transformer with neural architecture search, for example, emits 626,000 pounds of carbon dioxide \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;nearly five times the lifetime emissions of the average American car.\u0026rdquo;\n   As someone who trains quite a few deep learning models for my research, I was obviously curious to see how the energy consumption of my models stacked up. As the lead author of the paper points out, \u0026ldquo;training a single model is the minimum amount of work you can do.\u0026rdquo; Most deep learning research involves training, tuning, and re-training models repeatedly while prototyping and searching for optimal model settings. Therefore, instead of trying to estimate how much energy is consumed during the training of a single one of my models, I instead wanted to estimate my energy consumption during an average week of research. In an average week I\u0026rsquo;d guess that I probably have models training on 1-2 Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 GPUs about 50% of the time. A quick check of nvidia-smi shows that each GPU pulls around 200W during training.\n   2 GPUs, each running half of the time, leads to around 168 hours of GPU usage a week. That puts my weekly energy consumption for deep learning at 33.6 kWh. Following the paper, I then multiply by a factor of 1.58 to account for the additional energy required for cooling, leading to a weekly energy consumption of 53 kWh. Again, following from the paper,\n","date":1573603200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573603200,"objectID":"819d750f8329d6f649754ba050dc3655","permalink":"/post/carbon-footprint/","publishdate":"2019-11-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/carbon-footprint/","section":"post","summary":"Some back of the envelope calculations to determine the energetic costs of training my deep learning models.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Calculating my personal deep learning carbon footprint","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.
